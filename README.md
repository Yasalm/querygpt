# QueryGPT

An AI agent in your terminal that can connect to databases and generate insights using natural language queries. 
- It leverage LLM to generate documentation for each table and column and also any foreign relationship, and roleplay as data documenation expert to generate possible bussiness usage of them.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- API key for Google Gemini (currently the only supported LLM)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Yasalm/querygpt.git
   cd querygpt
   ```

2. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install the package and dependencies
   pip install -e .  # This will install all dependencies from requirements.txt
   
   # Alternatively, you can install dependencies directly
   # pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for your database connection and LLM API keys:
   ```bash
   # Database connection
   export DB_USER=postgres
   export DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   export DB_HOST=localhost
   export DB_PORT=5432
   export DB_NAME=your_database
   
   # LLM API keys
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
   ```

4. Configure your database connections in `config/config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   sources:
     default:
       engine: postgres
       user: ${env:DB_USER}
       password: ${env:DB_PASSWORD}
       host: ${env:DB_HOST}
       port: ${env:DB_PORT}
       dbname: ${env:DB_NAME}
       schema_query_path: /core/sql/postgres.sql
   ```

### Example Database Setup

You can use the Pagila example database (a sample movie rental database) to experiment with QueryGPT:

1. Use the provided Makefile commands to set up the example database:
   ```bash
   # Build and run the Pagila database
   make generate-pagila-db
   
   # To stop and remove the database container when done
   make cleanup-pagila-db
   
   # For help with available commands
   make help
   ```

2. Add the Pagila configuration to your config file:

   After setting up the Pagila database, add its configuration located at `example_databases/pagila/config.yaml` to the `sources` section 
   in your `config/config.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   # Add this to the sources section in your config/config.yaml
   pagila:
     engine: postgres
     user: postgres
     password: password
     host: localhost
     port: 5432
     dbname: pagila
     schema_query_path: /core/sql/postgres.sql
   ```

### Running QueryGPT

QueryGPT is an agentic system that uses a collection of tools to automatically analyze your database and answer complex questions without requiring SQL knowledge.

1. Use the CLI commands:
   ```bash
   # First, generate documentation from your database sources
   querygpt generate
   
   # Then run queries in natural language
   querygpt query "Analyze the rental patterns across different film categories and identify which categories show seasonal trends, comparing summer vs winter rentals for the past two years"
   ```

2. Start the API server and use it:
   ```bash
   # Start the API server
   python -m serving.serving
   
   # Then query the API
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "Find customers who spent more than the average in 2022, break down their spending by film category, and recommend three films they haven't watched based on their preferences"}'
   ```

## Configuration

The default configuration includes:
- **Index settings**: Vector search settings for documentation, including embedding dimensions and similarity metrics
- **Source database connections**: Connect to multiple databases with different credentials and schemas
- **Internal database**: Storage for metadata, documentation, query history, and access policies
- **LLM settings**: Configure your preferred AI model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), model parameters, and API credentials

All configuration options are documented with examples in the `config/config.yaml` file. You can customize these settings to match your specific requirements.
