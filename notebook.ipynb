Question breakdown\\n- **Business entities:** Transactions are the core entity.\\n- **Relationships:** Transactions are the focus, with the time of the transaction being the key attribute.\\n- **Operations:**\\n    - Grouping: Group transactions by the hour of the day.\\n    - Aggregation: Count the number of transactions within each hour.\\n    - Ordering: Order the results by transaction count in descending order.\\n    - Filtering: Adapt the time period to the available data (e.g., last week, month, or all time).\\n- **Time constraints:** The question requires identifying the time of day with the most transactions, implying a time-based analysis. The specific time period needs to be determined based on data availability.\\n- **Format:** The final answer should be a list of hours of the day and the corresponding transaction counts, ordered from highest to lowest transaction count.\\n\\n### 1.2. Data discovery needs\\n- **Database tables:** Likely tables include a \"transactions\" or \"orders\" table.\\n- **Columns:** Key columns include a timestamp column (e.g., \"transaction_time\", \"order_date\") and potentially an identifier for each transaction.\\n- **Search terms:** Search for tables related to \"transactions\", \"orders\", \"time\", \"hour\", or \"timestamp\".\\n- **Business context:** Understanding the meaning of the timestamp column is crucial. Is it the transaction creation time, order placement time, etc.?\\n- **Alternative data sources:** If no suitable table is found, consider other tables that might contain transaction data, like \"sales\" or \"payments\".\\n\\n### 1.3. SQL strategy requirements\\n- **SQL structure:** A `SELECT` statement with `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses is needed.\\n- **Table relationships:** A single table (e.g., \"transactions\") is likely involved.\\n- **WHERE clause:** A `WHERE` clause might be needed to filter the data based on the available time period (e.g., last week, last month, or all time).\\n- **GROUP BY:** Group by the hour extracted from the timestamp column.\\n- **ORDER BY:** Order by the count of transactions in descending order.\\n- **Complex analytical requirements:** No window functions or CTEs are immediately apparent, but may be needed depending on the specific data and desired output.\\n\\n## 2. Execution Plan\\n\\n1.  Use `get_all_tables()` to identify available tables in the database.\\n2.  Use `context_retiver()` with the query \"transactions time of day\" to identify relevant tables and columns, and their business documentation.\\n3.  Based on the context retrieved, use `sql_generator()` to generate an initial SQL query to extract the hour of the day from the timestamp column, count transactions per hour, and order the results. Provide instructions to adapt the time period to the available data.\\n4.  Use `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to execute the generated SQL query and retrieve the results.\\n5.  If the query fails or the results are not as expected, use `sql_generator()` again, providing the error message or the desired result format as instructions to refine the SQL query.\\n6.  Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to generate human-readable insights from the SQL result.\\n7.  Use `final_answer()` to present the final results.\\n\\\\n\\n```'},\n",

Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'json\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'json\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

You will be given a natural language question about data and need to convert it into SQL queries to get the answer.\\\\n\\\\nYour mission is to help users get insights from databases by:\\\\n1. Understanding their natural language questions about data\\\\n2. Discovering relevant database tables and columns using semantic search  \\\\n3. Generating accurate SQL queries that answer their questions\\\\n4. Executing the queries and providing business-friendly analysis\\\\n\\\\n## Your Systematic Approach for Database Questions:\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1: Understand the Question** - Parse what the user is asking for, identify key entities (customers, products, sales, etc.), required operations (filtering, grouping, sorting), and expected output.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 2: Discover Relevant Data** - Use `context_retiver()` to find tables and columns that match the question. Search using business terms rather than technical database names.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 3: Generate SQL** - Use `sql_generator()` with the discovered context to create a proper SQL query with correct joins, filters, and aggregations.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 4: Execute and Validate** - Run the SQL using `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to ensure it works and returns meaningful results.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 5: Analyze Results** - Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to create business-friendly insights from the query results.\\\\n\\\\nthe task is question asked by a user and he would like and answer to it, you have access to tools which are python functions that can help interact\\\\nwith databases, i.e. listing tables, columns, getting most similar tables and columns names by similarity search that search tables names, columns, bussiness \\\\nand techincal descrpitions.\\\\n\\\\nthe final answer must be provided in the format of json\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"analysis\\\\\": \\\\\"Your analysis of the result of the sql query for the given task, it must be humen-readable and not techincal\\\\\"\\\\n  \\\\\"sql\\\\\": \\\\\"sql query to answer the problem\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"The explanation of the query\\\\\"\\\\n  }```\\\\n \\\\n Final answer Guidelines:\\\\n    - Never return results, User only wants the above 3 fields\\\\n    - Use results internally to make sure the results answer the task\\\\n    - Focus on business insights and actionable takeaways in your analysis\\\\n    - Ensure the SQL query is validated and actually works before including it\\\\n    - Explain the query in plain English that non-technical users can understand\\\\n\\\\n## Key Strategies for SQL Generation:\\\\n- Always start with context retrieval - don\\'t assume you know which tables to use\\\\n- Use business terminology in your searches (e.g., \\\\\"customers\\\\\", \\\\\"sales\\\\\", \\\\\"revenue\\\\\") \\\\n- Validate your SQL queries by executing them before providing final answers\\\\n- For complex questions, break them down into smaller, manageable steps\\\\n- Focus on business value - your analysis should be meaningful to decision-makers\\\\n\\\\nAt each step, in the \\'Thought:\\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\\\nThen in the \\'Code:\\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with \\'<end_code>\\' sequence.\\\\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use \\'print()\\' to save whatever important information you will then need.\\\\nThese print outputs will then appear in the \\'Observation:\\' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\\\\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\\\\n\\\\n## Examples specific to database queries:\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\nTask: \\\\\"Which customers have spent the most money?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThought: I need to find customer and transaction/order data, then aggregate spending by customer.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'json\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Understanding their natural language questions about data\\\\n2. Discovering relevant database tables and columns using semantic search  \\\\n3. Generating accurate SQL queries that answer their questions\\\\n4. Executing the queries and providing business-friendly analysis\\\\n\\\\n## Your Systematic Approach for Database Questions:\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1: Understand the Question** - Parse what the user is asking for, identify key entities (customers, products, sales, etc.), required operations (filtering, grouping, sorting), and expected output.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 2: Discover Relevant Data** - Use `context_retiver()` to find tables and columns that match the question. Search using business terms rather than technical database names.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 3: Generate SQL** - Use `sql_generator()` with the discovered context to create a proper SQL query with correct joins, filters, and aggregations.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 4: Execute and Validate** - Run the SQL using `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to ensure it works and returns meaningful results.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 5: Analyze Results** - Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to create business-friendly insights from the query results.\\\\n\\\\nthe task is question asked by a user and he would like and answer to it, you have access to tools which are python functions that can help interact\\\\nwith databases, i.e. listing tables, columns, getting most similar tables and columns names by similarity search that search tables names, columns, bussiness \\\\nand techincal descrpitions.\\\\n\\\\nthe final answer must be provided in the format of json\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"analysis\\\\\": \\\\\"Your analysis of the result of the sql query for the given task, it must be humen-readable and not techincal\\\\\"\\\\n  \\\\\"sql\\\\\": \\\\\"sql query to answer the problem\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"The explanation of the query\\\\\"\\\\n  }```\\\\n \\\\n Final answer Guidelines:\\\\n    - Never return results, User only wants the above 3 fields\\\\n    - Use results internally to make sure the results answer the task\\\\n    - Focus on business insights and actionable takeaways in your analysis\\\\n    - Ensure the SQL query is validated and actually works before including it\\\\n    - Explain the query in plain English that non-technical users can understand\\\\n\\\\n## Key Strategies for SQL Generation:\\\\n- Always start with context retrieval - don\\'t assume you know which tables to use\\\\n- Use business terminology in your searches (e.g., \\\\\"customers\\\\\", \\\\\"sales\\\\\", \\\\\"revenue\\\\\") \\\\n- Validate your SQL queries by executing them before providing final answers\\\\n- For complex questions, break them down into smaller, manageable steps\\\\n- Focus on business value - your analysis should be meaningful to decision-makers\\\\n\\\\nAt each step, in the \\'Thought:\\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\\\nThen in the \\'Code:\\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'json\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Executing the queries and providing business-friendly analysis\\\\n\\\\n## Your Systematic Approach for Database Questions:\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1: Understand the Question** - Parse what the user is asking for, identify key entities (customers, products, sales, etc.), required operations (filtering, grouping, sorting), and expected output.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 2: Discover Relevant Data** - Use `context_retiver()` to find tables and columns that match the question.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'json\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

The `rental` table was also identified.\\n- **Relevant Columns:** The `payment_date` column in the `payment` and `payment_p2007_*` tables and the `rental_date` column in the `rental` table are relevant.\\n- **Context Retrieval:** The context retrieval successfully identified relevant tables and columns, including business summaries and column details.\\n\\n### 1.2. What has been attempted\\n- **SQL Query Generation:** A SQL query was generated to extract the hour of the day from the `payment_date` column, count the transactions, and order the results. The query used the `payment` table.\\n- **Query Execution:** The generated SQL query was executed successfully.\\n- **Results Obtained:** The query returned the hour with the most transactions (13:00 or 1 PM) and the corresponding transaction count (843).\\n- **Business Insights:** Insights were generated, identifying the peak transaction hour and suggesting resource optimization.\\n\\n### 1.3. What still needs to be done\\n- **Consider all payment tables:** The original query used only the `payment` table, which might not contain all the data. The `payment_p2007_*` tables contain data for specific months. The query should be modified to include all the available payment data.\\n- **Refine the time period:** The question asks to adapt the time period based on the available data. The current query uses all data from `payment`. However, it is important to check if the data covers the entire period or if it is only for a specific time.\\n- **Final Answer:** Present the final answer with the correct time period.\\n\\n## 2. Updated Execution Plan\\n\\n**Step 1: Combine all payment tables.**\\nSince the `payment` table might not contain all the data, and there are separate tables for each month (`payment_p2007_01` to `payment_p2007_06`), we will combine them using `UNION ALL`.\\n\\n**Step 2: Generate a new SQL query.**\\nGenerate a SQL query that extracts the hour of the day from `payment_date` (from all payment tables), counts the transactions, groups by hour, and orders by count in descending order.\\n\\n**Step 3: Execute the SQL query.**\\nExecute the generated SQL query and retrieve the results.\\n\\n**Step 4: Generate insights.**\\nGenerate insights from the SQL results.\\n\\n**Step 5: Provide a final answer.**\\nPresent the final answer, including the hour with the most transactions and the total count, along with any relevant context about the time period.\\n\\n```tool_code\\n# Step 1: Combine all payment tables.\\n# We don\\'t need to do this explicitly as the SQL generator will handle it.\\n\\n# Step 2: Generate a new SQL query.\\nsql_query = sql_generator(query=\"What is the time of day with the most transactions?

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'json\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\\\n\\\\nNow Begin!\"}], \"user\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Now proceed and carry out this plan.\"}], \"assistant\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I still need to solve the task I was given:\\\\n```\\\\nWhat is the time of day with the most transactions? Group the transactions by hour of the day and order the results from highest to lowest transaction count. (You should adapt the time period based on the available data, such as the last week, month, or all time.)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nHere are the facts I know and my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\\\\n```\\\\n## 1. Analysis of Current Progress\\\\n\\\\n### 1.1. What has been discovered\\\\n- **Database Tables:** The `payment` and `payment_p2007_01` through `payment_p2007_06` tables have been identified. The `rental` table was also identified.\\\\n- **Relevant Columns:** The `payment_date` column in the `payment` and `payment_p2007_*` tables and the `rental_date` column in the `rental` table are relevant.\\\\n- **Context Retrieval:** The context retrieval successfully identified relevant tables and columns, including business summaries and column details.\\\\n\\\\n### 1.2. What has been attempted\\\\n- **SQL Query Generation:** A SQL query was generated to extract the hour of the day from the `payment_date` column, count the transactions, and order the results. The query used the `payment` table.\\\\n- **Query Execution:** The generated SQL query was executed successfully.\\\\n- **Results Obtained:** The query returned the hour with the most transactions (13:00 or 1 PM) and the corresponding transaction count (843).\\\\n- **Business Insights:** Insights were generated, identifying the peak transaction hour and suggesting resource optimization.\\\\n\\\\n### 1.3. What still needs to be done\\\\n- **Consider all payment tables:** The original query used only the `payment` table, which might not contain all the data. The `payment_p2007_*` tables contain data for specific months. The query should be modified to include all the available payment data.\\\\n- **Refine the time period:** The question asks to adapt the time period based on the available data. The current query uses all data from `payment`. However, it is important to check if the data covers the entire period or if it is only for a specific time.\\\\n- **Final Answer:** Present the final answer with the correct time period.\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Updated Execution Plan\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1: Combine all payment tables.**\\\\nSince the `payment` table might not contain all the data, and there are separate tables for each month (`payment_p2007_01` to `payment_p2007_06`), we will combine them using `UNION ALL`.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 2: Generate a new SQL query.**\\\\nGenerate a SQL query that extracts the hour of the day from `payment_date` (from all payment tables), counts the transactions, groups by hour, and orders by count in descending order.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 3: Execute the SQL query.**\\\\nExecute the generated SQL query and retrieve the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 4: Generate insights.**\\\\nGenerate insights from the SQL results.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 5: Provide a final answer.**\\\\nPresent the final answer, including the hour with the most transactions and the total count, along with any relevant context about the time period.\\\\n\\\\n```tool_code\\\\n# Step 1: Combine all payment tables.\\\\n# We don\\'t need to do this explicitly as the SQL generator will handle it.\\\\n\\\\n# Step 2: Generate a new SQL query.\\\\nsql_query = sql_generator(query=\\\\\"What is the time of day with the most transactions?

Understanding their natural language questions about data\\\\n2. Discovering relevant database tables and columns using semantic search  \\\\n3. Generating accurate SQL queries that answer their questions\\\\n4. Executing the queries and providing business-friendly analysis\\\\n\\\\n## Your Systematic Approach for Database Questions:\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1: Understand the Question** - Parse what the user is asking for, identify key entities (customers, products, sales, etc.), required operations (filtering, grouping, sorting), and expected output.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 2: Discover Relevant Data** - Use `context_retiver()` to find tables and columns that match the question. Search using business terms rather than technical database names.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 3: Generate SQL** - Use `sql_generator()` with the discovered context to create a proper SQL query with correct joins, filters, and aggregations.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 4: Execute and Validate** - Run the SQL using `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to ensure it works and returns meaningful results.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 5: Analyze Results** - Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to create business-friendly insights from the query results.\\\\n\\\\nthe task is question asked by a user and he would like and answer to it, you have access to tools which are python functions that can help interact\\\\nwith databases, i.e. listing tables, columns, getting most similar tables and columns names by similarity search that search tables names, columns, bussiness \\\\nand techincal descrpitions.\\\\n\\\\nthe final answer must be provided in the format of json\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"analysis\\\\\": \\\\\"Your analysis of the result of the sql query for the given task, it must be humen-readable and not techincal\\\\\"\\\\n  \\\\\"sql\\\\\": \\\\\"sql query to answer the problem\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"The explanation of the query\\\\\"\\\\n  }```\\\\n \\\\n Final answer Guidelines:\\\\n    - Never return results, User only wants the above 3 fields\\\\n    - Use results internally to make sure the results answer the task\\\\n    - Focus on business insights and actionable takeaways in your analysis\\\\n    - Ensure the SQL query is validated and actually works before including it\\\\n    - Explain the query in plain English that non-technical users can understand\\\\n\\\\n## Key Strategies for SQL Generation:\\\\n- Always start with context retrieval - don\\'t assume you know which tables to use\\\\n- Use business terminology in your searches (e.g., \\\\\"customers\\\\\", \\\\\"sales\\\\\", \\\\\"revenue\\\\\") \\\\n- Validate your SQL queries by executing them before providing final answers\\\\n- For complex questions, break them down into smaller, manageable steps\\\\n- Focus on business value - your analysis should be meaningful to decision-makers\\\\n\\\\nAt each step, in the \\'Thought:\\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\\\nThen in the \\'Code:\\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'json\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'json\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\\\n\\\\nNow Begin!\"}], \"user\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Now proceed and carry out this plan.\"}], \"assistant\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"analysis\\\\\": \\\\\"The hour of the day with the most transactions is 1 PM (13:00), with a total of 843 transactions.

    "    ## Your Task:\n",
    "    Transform the following basic question into a complex, multi-dimensional analytical question that would thoroughly test an AI SQL generation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Original Question:** \"{user_question}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Enhancement Framework:\n",
    "    Follow this systematic approach to expand the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 1. Core Entity Analysis\n",
    "    - Identify the main business entities (customers, products, sales, etc.)\n",
    "    - Determine the primary metric or outcome being requested\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 2. Add Multiple Dimensions\n",
    "    - **Geographic**: Add location-based analysis (country, city, region)\n",
    "    - **Temporal**: Include time-based patterns (trends, seasonality, periods)\n",
    "    - **Categorical**: Segment by relevant categories (product types, customer segments, etc.)\n",
    "    - **Comparative**: Add ranking, top/bottom analysis, or comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 3. Include Business Intelligence Aspects\n",
    "    - **Financial metrics**: Revenue, profit, ROI, margins, costs\n",
    "    - **Performance indicators**: Efficiency, utilization, conversion rates\n",
    "    - **Behavioral analysis**: Patterns, preferences, loyalty, churn\n",
    "    - **Correlation analysis**: Relationships between different factors\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 4. Make it Actionable\n",
    "    - Add \"why\" elements that provide business insights\n",
    "    - Include optimization opportunities\n",
    "    - Suggest strategic implications\n",
    "    - Connect to business decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 5. Increase Technical Complexity\n",
    "    - Require multiple table joins\n",
    "    - Need advanced SQL functions (window functions, CTEs, etc.)\n",
    "    - Involve complex calculations or aggregations\n",
    "    - Test edge cases and data quality handling\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Examples of Transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Simple:** \"Who are our top customers?\"\n",
    "    **Enhanced:** \"Identify the top 10 customers by lifetime value in each geographic region, analyze their purchasing patterns and category preferences, determine which staff members they prefer to work with, and calculate their profitability considering acquisition and service costs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Simple:** \"Which products sell the most?\"\n",
    "    **Enhanced:** \"Which product categories have the highest sales velocity and profit margins, how do they perform across different seasons and customer segments, and what cross-selling opportunities exist based on purchase patterns?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Simple:** \"Show me sales by month\"\n",
    "    **Enhanced:** \"Analyze monthly sales trends across different customer segments and geographic regions, identify seasonal patterns and anomalies, calculate year-over-year growth rates, and predict which factors most influence sales performance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Your Enhanced Question:\n",
    "    Provide a comprehensive, analytical version of the original question that would:\n",
    "    1. Test multiple database tables and complex joins\n",
    "    2. Require advanced SQL analytical functions\n",
    "    3. Generate actionable business insights\n",
    "    4. Challenge the AI's ability to understand business context\n",
    "    5. Involve multi-dimensional analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Enhanced Question:** [Your transformation here]\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Key Testing Areas:** [List what aspects of SQL generation this would test]\n",

    "        - What exactly should be measured/counted/analyzed?\n",
    "        - What specific filters or conditions?\n",
    "        - **Time period (only if relevant):** When adding time constraints, make them flexible so the you can adapt based on available data\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### 2. Define the Output\n",
    "        - What format should the results be in?\n",
    "        - How should results be ordered/ranked?\n",
    "        - How many results are needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### 3. Clarify Ambiguous Terms\n",
    "        - Replace vague terms with specific business concepts\n",
    "        - Define what \"top\", \"best\", \"most\", \"popular\" means\n",
    "        - Specify metrics for comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "        ## Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Ambiguous:** \"Show me the best customers\"\n",
    "        **Clarified:** \"Show me the top 10 customers ranked by total spending, ordered from highest to lowest\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Ambiguous:** \"Which staff are doing good?\"\n",
    "        **Clarified:** \"Which staff members have the highest total sales, ordered from highest to lowest? (you should adapt time period based on available data - could be recent period, all time, or most active period in database)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Ambiguous:** \"Which movies are popular?\"\n",
    "        **Clarified:** \"Which films have been rented the most times, ordered by rental count?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Ambiguous:** \"How are sales doing?\"\n",
    "        **Clarified:** \"What is the total rental revenue over time? (you should determine appropriate time grouping - monthly, weekly, or quarterly - based on data range available)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        ## Your Clarified Question:\n",
    "        Make the original question specific and unambiguous. If time periods are suggested, make them adaptive so the you can adjust based on what data actually exists.\n",

       "   'plan': 'Here are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n## 1. Question Analysis and Data Requirements\\n\\n### 1.1. Question breakdown\\n- **Business entities:** Stores, rentals, movies.\\n- **Relationships:**  A store has many rentals. Rentals relate to movies.\\n- **Operations:**\\n    - Filtering: Potentially filtering by time period (e.g., all-time, recent period).\\n    - Grouping: Grouping rentals by store location and movie title.\\n    - Aggregation: Counting rentals (SUM or COUNT).\\n    - Sorting: Ranking stores by total rentals and movies by rental count.\\n    - Joining: Joining tables to link store location to rentals and rentals to movies.\\n- **Time constraints:**  The question asks to adapt to the available data, so we need to determine the time range of the data and use it.\\n- **Format of the final answer:**\\n    - Part 1: The store location with the highest total rentals.\\n    - Part 2: A list of the top 10 movies and their rental counts.\\n\\n### 1.2. Data discovery needs\\n- **Database tables and columns:**\\n    - Likely tables: `stores`, `rentals`, `movies`, and possibly tables related to inventory or film copies.\\n    - Relevant columns: `store_id` (in `stores` and `rentals`), `rental_id` (in `rentals`), `movie_id` (in `rentals`), `title` (in `movies`), `rental_date` or similar (in `rentals`).\\n- **Search terms:** \"store location\", \"rentals\", \"highest\", \"top 10 movies\", \"rental count\", \"movie title\".\\n- **Business context or domain knowledge:**  Understanding the relationships between stores, rentals, and movies.\\n- **Alternative data sources:** If there is no direct `rentals` table, we might need to infer rentals from other tables like `inventory` or `sales`.\\n\\n### 1.3. SQL strategy requirements\\n- **SQL query structure:**\\n    - Part 1: `SELECT store_id, COUNT(*) FROM rentals GROUP BY store_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;` (or similar, depending on table and column names).\\n    - Part 2: `SELECT movie_title, COUNT(*) FROM rentals JOIN movies ON rentals.movie_id = movies.movie_id GROUP BY movie_title ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 10;` (or similar).\\n    - Potentially a single query using CTEs or subqueries to get both results.\\n- **Table relationships and join conditions:**  Joining `rentals` to `stores` on `store_id` and `rentals` to `movies` on `movie_id`.\\n- **WHERE clauses:**  Potentially a `WHERE` clause to filter by a time period (e.g., `rental_date BETWEEN ...`).\\n- **GROUP BY, ORDER BY operations:**  `GROUP BY` store_id and movie_title, `ORDER BY` count of rentals in descending order, `LIMIT` to get the top results.\\n- **Complex analytical requirements:**  Potentially using window functions if we need to rank movies within a time period, but not strictly required.\\n\\n## 2. Execution Plan\\n\\n1.  Use `get_all_tables()` to list all tables in the database.\\n2.  Use `context_retiver()` with the query to find the most relevant tables and columns, including their descriptions and relationships.\\n3.  Based on the information from `context_retiver()`, use `sql_generator()` to generate the first SQL query to find the store location with the highest number of rentals. Provide the query and context from the previous step as input.\\n4.  Use `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to execute the generated SQL query and get the result for the store with the highest rentals.\\n5.  Use `sql_generator()` to generate the second SQL query to find the top 10 movies with the highest rental count. Provide the query and context from the previous step as input.\\n6.  Use `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to execute the generated SQL query and get the results for the top 10 movies.\\n7.  Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to generate human-readable insights from the results of the first query (store location).\\n8.  Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to generate human-readable insights from the results of the second query (top 10 movies).\\n9.  Use `final_answer()` to combine the insights from both queries and provide the final answer.\\n\\\\n\\n```'},\n",

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6.

Question Analysis and Data Requirements\\\\n\\\\n### 1.1. Question breakdown\\\\n- **Business entities:** Stores, rentals, movies.\\\\n- **Relationships:**  A store has many rentals. Rentals relate to movies.\\\\n- **Operations:**\\\\n    - Filtering: Potentially filtering by time period (e.g., all-time, recent period).\\\\n    - Grouping: Grouping rentals by store location and movie title.\\\\n    - Aggregation: Counting rentals (SUM or COUNT).\\\\n    - Sorting: Ranking stores by total rentals and movies by rental count.\\\\n    - Joining: Joining tables to link store location to rentals and rentals to movies.\\\\n- **Time constraints:**  The question asks to adapt to the available data, so we need to determine the time range of the data and use it.\\\\n- **Format of the final answer:**\\\\n    - Part 1: The store location with the highest total rentals.\\\\n    - Part 2: A list of the top 10 movies and their rental counts.\\\\n\\\\n### 1.2. Data discovery needs\\\\n- **Database tables and columns:**\\\\n    - Likely tables: `stores`, `rentals`, `movies`, and possibly tables related to inventory or film copies.\\\\n    - Relevant columns: `store_id` (in `stores` and `rentals`), `rental_id` (in `rentals`), `movie_id` (in `rentals`), `title` (in `movies`), `rental_date` or similar (in `rentals`).\\\\n- **Search terms:** \\\\\"store location\\\\\", \\\\\"rentals\\\\\", \\\\\"highest\\\\\", \\\\\"top 10 movies\\\\\", \\\\\"rental count\\\\\", \\\\\"movie title\\\\\".\\\\n- **Business context or domain knowledge:**  Understanding the relationships between stores, rentals, and movies.\\\\n- **Alternative data sources:** If there is no direct `rentals` table, we might need to infer rentals from other tables like `inventory` or `sales`.\\\\n\\\\n### 1.3. SQL strategy requirements\\\\n- **SQL query structure:**\\\\n    - Part 1: `SELECT store_id, COUNT(*) FROM rentals GROUP BY store_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;` (or similar, depending on table and column names).\\\\n    - Part 2: `SELECT movie_title, COUNT(*) FROM rentals JOIN movies ON rentals.movie_id = movies.movie_id GROUP BY movie_title ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 10;` (or similar).\\\\n    - Potentially a single query using CTEs or subqueries to get both results.\\\\n- **Table relationships and join conditions:**  Joining `rentals` to `stores` on `store_id` and `rentals` to `movies` on `movie_id`.\\\\n- **WHERE clauses:**  Potentially a `WHERE` clause to filter by a time period (e.g., `rental_date BETWEEN ...`).\\\\n- **GROUP BY, ORDER BY operations:**  `GROUP BY` store_id and movie_title, `ORDER BY` count of rentals in descending order, `LIMIT` to get the top results.\\\\n- **Complex analytical requirements:**  Potentially using window functions if we need to rank movies within a time period, but not strictly required.\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Execution Plan\\\\n\\\\n1.  Use `get_all_tables()` to list all tables in the database.\\\\n2.  Use `context_retiver()` with the query to find the most relevant tables and columns, including their descriptions and relationships.\\\\n3.  Based on the information from `context_retiver()`, use `sql_generator()` to generate the first SQL query to find the store location with the highest number of rentals. Provide the query and context from the previous step as input.\\\\n4.  Use `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to execute the generated SQL query and get the result for the store with the highest rentals.\\\\n5.  Use `sql_generator()` to generate the second SQL query to find the top 10 movies with the highest rental count. Provide the query and context from the previous step as input.\\\\n6.  Use `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to execute the generated SQL query and get the results for the top 10 movies.\\\\n7.  Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to generate human-readable insights from the results of the first query (store location).\\\\n8.  Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to generate human-readable insights from the results of the second query (top 10 movies).\\\\n9.  Use `final_answer()` to combine the insights from both queries and provide the final answer.\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\n```\"}]}]',\n",

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7.

You will be given a natural language question about data and need to convert it into SQL queries to get the answer.\\\\n\\\\nYour mission is to help users get insights from databases by:\\\\n1. Understanding their natural language questions about data\\\\n2. Discovering relevant database tables and columns using semantic search  \\\\n3. Generating accurate SQL queries that answer their questions\\\\n4. Executing the queries and providing business-friendly analysis\\\\n\\\\n## Your Systematic Approach for Database Questions:\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1: Understand the Question** - Parse what the user is asking for, identify key entities (customers, products, sales, etc.), required operations (filtering, grouping, sorting), and expected output.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 2: Discover Relevant Data** - Use `context_retiver()` to find tables and columns that match the question. Search using business terms rather than technical database names.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 3: Generate SQL** - Use `sql_generator()` with the discovered context to create a proper SQL query with correct joins, filters, and aggregations.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 4: Execute and Validate** - Run the SQL using `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to ensure it works and returns meaningful results.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 5: Analyze Results** - Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to create business-friendly insights from the query results.\\\\n\\\\nthe task is question asked by a user and he would like and answer to it, you have access to tools which are python functions that can help interact\\\\nwith databases, i.e. listing tables, columns, getting most similar tables and columns names by similarity search that search tables names, columns, bussiness \\\\nand techincal descrpitions.\\\\n\\\\nthe final answer must be provided in the format of json\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"analysis\\\\\": \\\\\"Your analysis of the result of the sql query for the given task, it must be humen-readable and not techincal\\\\\"\\\\n  \\\\\"sql\\\\\": \\\\\"sql query to answer the problem\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"The explanation of the query\\\\\"\\\\n  }```\\\\n \\\\n Final answer Guidelines:\\\\n    - Never return results, User only wants the above 3 fields\\\\n    - Use results internally to make sure the results answer the task\\\\n    - Focus on business insights and actionable takeaways in your analysis\\\\n    - Ensure the SQL query is validated and actually works before including it\\\\n    - Explain the query in plain English that non-technical users can understand\\\\n\\\\n## Key Strategies for SQL Generation:\\\\n- Always start with context retrieval - don\\'t assume you know which tables to use\\\\n- Use business terminology in your searches (e.g., \\\\\"customers\\\\\", \\\\\"sales\\\\\", \\\\\"revenue\\\\\") \\\\n- Validate your SQL queries by executing them before providing final answers\\\\n- For complex questions, break them down into smaller, manageable steps\\\\n- Focus on business value - your analysis should be meaningful to decision-makers\\\\n\\\\nAt each step, in the \\'Thought:\\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\\\nThen in the \\'Code:\\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'json\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

You will be given a natural language question about data and need to convert it into SQL queries to get the answer.\\\\n\\\\nYour mission is to help users get insights from databases by:\\\\n1. Understanding their natural language questions about data\\\\n2. Discovering relevant database tables and columns using semantic search  \\\\n3. Generating accurate SQL queries that answer their questions\\\\n4. Executing the queries and providing business-friendly analysis\\\\n\\\\n## Your Systematic Approach for Database Questions:\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1: Understand the Question** - Parse what the user is asking for, identify key entities (customers, products, sales, etc.), required operations (filtering, grouping, sorting), and expected output.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 2: Discover Relevant Data** - Use `context_retiver()` to find tables and columns that match the question. Search using business terms rather than technical database names.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 3: Generate SQL** - Use `sql_generator()` with the discovered context to create a proper SQL query with correct joins, filters, and aggregations.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 4: Execute and Validate** - Run the SQL using `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to ensure it works and returns meaningful results.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 5: Analyze Results** - Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to create business-friendly insights from the query results.\\\\n\\\\nthe task is question asked by a user and he would like and answer to it, you have access to tools which are python functions that can help interact\\\\nwith databases, i.e. listing tables, columns, getting most similar tables and columns names by similarity search that search tables names, columns, bussiness \\\\nand techincal descrpitions.\\\\n\\\\nthe final answer must be provided in the format of json\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"analysis\\\\\": \\\\\"Your analysis of the result of the sql query for the given task, it must be humen-readable and not techincal\\\\\"\\\\n  \\\\\"sql\\\\\": \\\\\"sql query to answer the problem\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"The explanation of the query\\\\\"\\\\n  }```\\\\n \\\\n Final answer Guidelines:\\\\n    - Never return results, User only wants the above 3 fields\\\\n    - Use results internally to make sure the results answer the task\\\\n    - Focus on business insights and actionable takeaways in your analysis\\\\n    - Ensure the SQL query is validated and actually works before including it\\\\n    - Explain the query in plain English that non-technical users can understand\\\\n\\\\n## Key Strategies for SQL Generation:\\\\n- Always start with context retrieval - don\\'t assume you know which tables to use\\\\n- Use business terminology in your searches (e.g., \\\\\"customers\\\\\", \\\\\"sales\\\\\", \\\\\"revenue\\\\\") \\\\n- Validate your SQL queries by executing them before providing final answers\\\\n- For complex questions, break them down into smaller, manageable steps\\\\n- Focus on business value - your analysis should be meaningful to decision-makers\\\\n\\\\nAt each step, in the \\'Thought:\\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\\\nThen in the \\'Code:\\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python.

Executing the queries and providing business-friendly analysis\\\\n\\\\n## Your Systematic Approach for Database Questions:\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1: Understand the Question** - Parse what the user is asking for, identify key entities (customers, products, sales, etc.), required operations (filtering, grouping, sorting), and expected output.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 2: Discover Relevant Data** - Use `context_retiver()` to find tables and columns that match the question. Search using business terms rather than technical database names.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 3: Generate SQL** - Use `sql_generator()` with the discovered context to create a proper SQL query with correct joins, filters, and aggregations.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 4: Execute and Validate** - Run the SQL using `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to ensure it works and returns meaningful results.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 5: Analyze Results** - Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to create business-friendly insights from the query results.\\\\n\\\\nthe task is question asked by a user and he would like and answer to it, you have access to tools which are python functions that can help interact\\\\nwith databases, i.e. listing tables, columns, getting most similar tables and columns names by similarity search that search tables names, columns, bussiness \\\\nand techincal descrpitions.\\\\n\\\\nthe final answer must be provided in the format of json\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"analysis\\\\\": \\\\\"Your analysis of the result of the sql query for the given task, it must be humen-readable and not techincal\\\\\"\\\\n  \\\\\"sql\\\\\": \\\\\"sql query to answer the problem\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"The explanation of the query\\\\\"\\\\n  }```\\\\n \\\\n Final answer Guidelines:\\\\n    - Never return results, User only wants the above 3 fields\\\\n    - Use results internally to make sure the results answer the task\\\\n    - Focus on business insights and actionable takeaways in your analysis\\\\n    - Ensure the SQL query is validated and actually works before including it\\\\n    - Explain the query in plain English that non-technical users can understand\\\\n\\\\n## Key Strategies for SQL Generation:\\\\n- Always start with context retrieval - don\\'t assume you know which tables to use\\\\n- Use business terminology in your searches (e.g., \\\\\"customers\\\\\", \\\\\"sales\\\\\", \\\\\"revenue\\\\\") \\\\n- Validate your SQL queries by executing them before providing final answers\\\\n- For complex questions, break them down into smaller, manageable steps\\\\n- Focus on business value - your analysis should be meaningful to decision-makers\\\\n\\\\nAt each step, in the \\'Thought:\\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\\\nThen in the \\'Code:\\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python.

Understanding their natural language questions about data\\\\n2. Discovering relevant database tables and columns using semantic search  \\\\n3. Generating accurate SQL queries that answer their questions\\\\n4. Executing the queries and providing business-friendly analysis\\\\n\\\\n## Your Systematic Approach for Database Questions:\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1: Understand the Question** - Parse what the user is asking for, identify key entities (customers, products, sales, etc.), required operations (filtering, grouping, sorting), and expected output.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 2: Discover Relevant Data** - Use `context_retiver()` to find tables and columns that match the question. Search using business terms rather than technical database names.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 3: Generate SQL** - Use `sql_generator()` with the discovered context to create a proper SQL query with correct joins, filters, and aggregations.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 4: Execute and Validate** - Run the SQL using `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to ensure it works and returns meaningful results.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 5: Analyze Results** - Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to create business-friendly insights from the query results.\\\\n\\\\nthe task is question asked by a user and he would like and answer to it, you have access to tools which are python functions that can help interact\\\\nwith databases, i.e. listing tables, columns, getting most similar tables and columns names by similarity search that search tables names, columns, bussiness \\\\nand techincal descrpitions.\\\\n\\\\nthe final answer must be provided in the format of json\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"analysis\\\\\": \\\\\"Your analysis of the result of the sql query for the given task, it must be humen-readable and not techincal\\\\\"\\\\n  \\\\\"sql\\\\\": \\\\\"sql query to answer the problem\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"The explanation of the query\\\\\"\\\\n  }```\\\\n \\\\n Final answer Guidelines:\\\\n    - Never return results, User only wants the above 3 fields\\\\n    - Use results internally to make sure the results answer the task\\\\n    - Focus on business insights and actionable takeaways in your analysis\\\\n    - Ensure the SQL query is validated and actually works before including it\\\\n    - Explain the query in plain English that non-technical users can understand\\\\n\\\\n## Key Strategies for SQL Generation:\\\\n- Always start with context retrieval - don\\'t assume you know which tables to use\\\\n- Use business terminology in your searches (e.g., \\\\\"customers\\\\\", \\\\\"sales\\\\\", \\\\\"revenue\\\\\") \\\\n- Validate your SQL queries by executing them before providing final answers\\\\n- For complex questions, break them down into smaller, manageable steps\\\\n- Focus on business value - your analysis should be meaningful to decision-makers\\\\n\\\\nAt each step, in the \\'Thought:\\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\\\nThen in the \\'Code:\\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'json\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\\\n\\\\nNow Begin!\"}], \"user\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Now proceed and carry out this plan.\"}], \"assistant\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I still need to solve the task I was given:\\\\n```\\\\n1.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'json\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Search using business terms rather than technical database names.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 3: Generate SQL** - Use `sql_generator()` with the discovered context to create a proper SQL query with correct joins, filters, and aggregations.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 4: Execute and Validate** - Run the SQL using `validate_sql_and_exceute_it()` to ensure it works and returns meaningful results.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 5: Analyze Results** - Use `generate_insghits_from_sql_result()` to create business-friendly insights from the query results.\\\\n\\\\nthe task is question asked by a user and he would like and answer to it, you have access to tools which are python functions that can help interact\\\\nwith databases, i.e. listing tables, columns, getting most similar tables and columns names by similarity search that search tables names, columns, bussiness \\\\nand techincal descrpitions.\\\\n\\\\nthe final answer must be provided in the format of json\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"analysis\\\\\": \\\\\"Your analysis of the result of the sql query for the given task, it must be humen-readable and not techincal\\\\\"\\\\n  \\\\\"sql\\\\\": \\\\\"sql query to answer the problem\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"The explanation of the query\\\\\"\\\\n  }```\\\\n \\\\n Final answer Guidelines:\\\\n    - Never return results, User only wants the above 3 fields\\\\n    - Use results internally to make sure the results answer the task\\\\n    - Focus on business insights and actionable takeaways in your analysis\\\\n    - Ensure the SQL query is validated and actually works before including it\\\\n    - Explain the query in plain English that non-technical users can understand\\\\n\\\\n## Key Strategies for SQL Generation:\\\\n- Always start with context retrieval - don\\'t assume you know which tables to use\\\\n- Use business terminology in your searches (e.g., \\\\\"customers\\\\\", \\\\\"sales\\\\\", \\\\\"revenue\\\\\") \\\\n- Validate your SQL queries by executing them before providing final answers\\\\n- For complex questions, break them down into smaller, manageable steps\\\\n- Focus on business value - your analysis should be meaningful to decision-makers\\\\n\\\\nAt each step, in the \\'Thought:\\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\\\nThen in the \\'Code:\\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with \\'<end_code>\\' sequence.\\\\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use \\'print()\\' to save whatever important information you will then need.\\\\nThese print outputs will then appear in the \\'Observation:\\' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\\\\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\\\\n\\\\n## Examples specific to database queries:\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\nTask: \\\\\"Which customers have spent the most money?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThought: I need to find customer and transaction/order data, then aggregate spending by customer. Let me start by discovering relevant tables and columns.\\\\nCode:\\\\n```py\\\\ncontext = context_retiver(query=\\\\\"customers spending money orders transactions revenue\\\\\")\\\\nprint(context)\\\\n```<end_code>\\\\nObservation: Found customer table and order/payment tables with amount columns.\\\\n\\\\nThought: Now I\\'ll generate SQL to sum spending per customer and sort by total amount.\\\\nCode:\\\\n```py\\\\nsql_query = sql_generator(query=\\\\\"customers who spent the most money\\\\\", context=context)\\\\nprint(sql_query)\\\\n```<end_code>\\\\nObservation: Generated SQL with JOIN and SUM aggregation.\\\\n\\\\nThought: Let me execute this SQL to get the results.\\\\nCode:\\\\n```py\\\\nresults = validate_sql_and_exceute_it(sql=sql_query)\\\\nprint(results)\\\\n```<end_code>\\\\nObservation: Query executed successfully with top customers by spending.\\\\n\\\\nThought: Now I\\'ll provide business insights and the final answer.\\\\nCode:\\\\n```py\\\\ninsights = generate_insghits_from_sql_result(query=\\\\\"customers who spent the most money\\\\\", sql_result=results)\\\\nfinal_answer({\\\\n  \\\\\"analysis\\\\\": \\\\\"Top customers identified for VIP programs and targeted marketing\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"sql\\\\\": sql_query,\\\\n  \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"Joins customer and order tables, sums total spending per customer, orders by highest spending first\\\\\"\\\\n})\\\\n```<end_code>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\nTask: \\\\\"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\\\\nCode:\\\\n```py\\\\nfor city in [\\\\\"Guangzhou\\\\\", \\\\\"Shanghai\\\\\"]:\\\\n    print(f\\\\\"Population {city}:\\\\\", search(f\\\\\"{city} population\\\\\")\\\\n```<end_code>\\\\nObservation:\\\\nPopulation Guangzhou: [\\'Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.\\']\\\\nPopulation Shanghai: \\'26 million (2019)\\'\\\\n\\\\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\\\\nCode:\\\\n```py\\\\nfinal_answer(\\\\\"Shanghai\\\\\")\\\\n```<end_code>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\nTask: \\\\\"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\\\\nCode:\\\\n```py\\\\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\\\\\"current pope age\\\\\")\\\\nprint(\\\\\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\\\\\", pope_age_wiki)\\\\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\\\\\"current pope age\\\\\")\\\\nprint(\\\\\"Pope age as per google search:\\\\\", pope_age_search)\\\\n```<end_code>\\\\nObservation:\\\\nPope age: \\\\\"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let\\'s compute the result using python code.\\\\nCode:\\\\n```py\\\\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\\\\n```<end_code>\\\\n\\\\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\\\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\\\")\\'.\\\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'json\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\\\n\\\\nNow Begin!\"}], \"user\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Now proceed and carry out this plan.\"}], \"assistant\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I apologize for the error in the previous response.
